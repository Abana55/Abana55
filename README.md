👋 Hey there, I’m @Abana55!

👀 I’m really into creating cool stuff with front-end technologies like React. I love finding tech solutions for everyday challenges.

🌱 Currently diving deeper into React and playing around with Chart.js for fun data visuals.

💞️ Keen to join forces on web projects that are all about great user experience or innovative fin-tech.

📫 Reach out to me at [Your Email/LinkedIn]. I'm always up for a chat about tech, new ideas, or anything interesting!

⚡ Fun fact: I used to make furniture, which turned out to be a great way to sharpen my design skills for software development. Who knew, right?
